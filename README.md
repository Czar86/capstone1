### What does this program do?
This project provides the user with a task manager which allows an administrator to create different user logins and assign tasks with deadlines. All saved data is exported to a text file which can be updated via the program. Users can login in and view tasks as well as mark them as completed. The program also allows the administrator to view various statistics about task completion, missed deadlines etc. which is also exported to a text file.
### How to get started.
You need all two files for the program to run successfully. Ensure you copy the txt file into the appopriate directory so your compiler can read from it. The default superuser/admin login details you need to begin the program is username: admin  password: adm1n
### Final notes.
I will be adding a GUI to the program in the next update. Stay tuned...
